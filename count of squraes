Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.

 

Example 1:

Input :
N = 9
Output:
2
Explanation:
1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares
less than 9. So, the Output is 2.

class Solution {
  public:
    int countSquares(int N) {
          int count=0;
        for(int i=1;i<N;i++){
            if((i*i)<N){
                count++;
            }else{
                
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
