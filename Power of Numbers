Given a number and its reverse. Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2, R = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2 and after raising power of 2 by 2 we get 4 which gives remainder as 4 when divided by 1000000007.

 public:
    //You need to complete this fucntion
    
    long long power(int N,int R)
    {
       //Your code here
       int mod=1e9+7;
      if(R==1) return N;
      if(R==0) return 1;
      
      long long r=power(N,R/2)%mod;
      r=(r*r)%mod;
      
      if(R&1) r=(r*N)%mod;
      
      return r;
        
    }
